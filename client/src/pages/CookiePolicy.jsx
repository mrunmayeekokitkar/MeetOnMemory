      We believe in absolute transparency regarding how we handle your data. In line with modern privacy standards (such as GDPR, CCPA, and the ePrivacy Directive), this policy outlines what cookies are, why we use them, and the granular controls you possess to manage your browser storage configuration at any time.

      Depending on their origin and duration, cookies can be categorized as follows:
      
      - First-Party Cookies: Set directly by MeetOnMemory. These are primarily used to keep you securely signed in and to preserve user settings like dark mode and language preferences.
      - Third-Party Cookies: Placed by domain partners (such as analytics providers or cloud infrastructure tools) to track usage metrics or run external assets.
      - Session Cookies: Temporary cookies that expire and are automatically erased when you close your web browser.
      - Persistent Cookies: Remain on your device's storage for a specified period or until you manually delete them. These help us remember you when you return.`,

      Our cookies serve the following core categories of operational functionality:
      
      A. Authentication & Security:
      Verifying your login sessions, preventing cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, and identifying active organization memberships.
      
      B. User Experience & Customization:
      Remembering your interface preferences, such as light vs. dark mode, active dashboard layouts, language filters (English/Hindi), and sidebar visibility states.
      
      C. Performance & Scale:
      Distributing incoming API request traffic across our cloud server clusters to prevent service disruption and slow loading times during high-volume transcription queues.
      
      D. Usage Analytics:
      Aggregating anonymous, de-identified statistics on page interaction speeds, feature popularity, and browser compatibility to refine our platform.`,

      These cookies are essential for you to browse our site and use its secure features. Without them, features like user authentication, multi-tenant workspace isolation, and session maintenance will fail.
      
      2. Functional Cookies:
      These allow our web application to remember choices you make (such as your sidebar navigation state, dark mode preferences, or customized meeting dashboard filters) to deliver a highly personalized experience.
      
      3. Performance & Analytics Cookies:
      These collect information about how visitors use MeetOnMemory—for example, which pages are visited most often and if any server errors occur. The data collected is aggregated and anonymous.

      B. Pinecone Vector Isolation:
      Your organization's vector search embeddings are indexed using logical Organization ID keys on our cloud database. Browser cookies are only used to authenticate your authorization to query these indexes. No search history or query vectors are stored in persistent browser cookies.
